## Setup

### Character File

Below is a bare-bones character file:

```json
{
  "mouthsPath": "defaults/mouths/",
  "poses": {
    "imagesFolder": "defaults/SampleCharacter/faces/",
    "default": {
      "image": "purple.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400
    },
    "green": {
      "image": "blue.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400
    }
  }
}
```

`mouthsPath` specifies the path to a folder containing the mouth images.

`poses` contains two main elements. `imagesFolder` specifies the path to the folder which contains the pose images. `default` is a pose object. `image` refers to the name of the image inside the imagesFolder. `x` and `y` are the coordinates where the mouth should be placed. More poses can be created with more pose objects, as is shown with the `green` pose.

A more fleshed out character file could look like this:

```json
{
  "mouthsPath": "defaults/mouths/",
  "poses": {
    "imagesFolder": "defaults/SampleCharacter/faces/",
    "default_scale": 2,
    "default": {
      "image": "purple.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400,
      "facingLeft": false,
      "scale": 2
    },
    "green": {
      "image": "green.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400,
      "facingLeft": false,
      "scale": 1
    }
  },
  "eyes": {
    "imagesFolder": "defaults/SampleCharacter/eyes/",
    "scale": 0.8,
    "x": 640,
    "y": 300,
    "images": {
      "angry": "angry.png",
      "normal": "normal.png",
      "sad": "sad.png"
    }
  }
}
```

`default_scale` says how much the mouth should be scaled up or down. `scale` is the same thing for a specific pose. In this case, the mouths for the `default` pose with be 4x the image size, while the mouths for the `green` pose will only be 2x the size.

`eyes` specifies a "placeable part". The sample character pose images don't have eyes, as these are specified by placeable parts. Although this example has placeable eyes, you can have placeable pins, objects in the background, or even hats. The `imagesFolder` specifies the path to the folder contains the images for the placeable part. `scale` specifies how much the placeable part image should be scaled up or down. `x` and `y` specify the location on the pose where the part should be placed. `images` contained key-value pairs where the key is the name of the part, and the value is the image name. This section shows angry, normal, and sad eye selections.

### Timestamps

The timestamps file is composed of a list of pose changes along with how many milliseconds into the animation the pose should change. For instance, if you wanted to swap to the `happy` pose after 3.5 seconds, the timestamps file will look like:

> 3500 happy

Additionally, you can change a placeable part by adding the type afterwards.

> 0 angry eyes

You can also remove a placeable part by using the name `None`

> 5000 None eyes

## Usage

### Arguments

#### Default Arguments

This covers the most important flags and arguments. For the complete list, go to [Default Arguments](defaults/default_args.json).

| Shortcut | Command              | Required | Default                    | Type                 | Description                                      |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| --a      | --audio              | \*       |                            | str                  | The path to the audio file being animated        |
|          | --aligning_algorithm |          | gentle                     | gentle \| allosaurus | The aligning algorithm to be used.               |
| --t      | --timestamps         |          |                            | str                  | The path to the file containing pose timestamps. |
| --o      | --output             |          | "defaults/output.mp4"      | str                  | The output of the program                        |
| --c      | --character          |          | "defaults/characters.json" | str                  | The list of character poses                      |
| --m      | --mouths             |          | "defaults/phonemes.json"   | str                  | The mouth pack and phonemes list                 |
| --V      | --verbose            |          | 1                          | int                  | Dump process outputs to the shell                |

#### Custom Defaults

You can set custom default arguments by creating a file `config.json` in the main folder. In this file, the key is the command and the value is what you want the new default to be. For instance, if you wanted to always be set to verbose mode 3, your file will be:

```json
{
    "verbose": 3,
    "no_docker": true
}
```

### Running

The command to create an animation is the same for all supported platforms

#### Windows

```shell
npm run animate -- -a audio.wav [optional arguments]
```

#### Ubuntu/Mac

```shell

sudo docker run --name gentle -p 8765:8765 lowerquality/gentle 

npm run animate -- --no_docker -a audio.wav [optional arguments]
```
