## Setup

### Character Folder

See [/defaults/SampleCharacter](https://github.com/Matamata-Animator/Matamata-Core/tree/main/defaults/SampleCharacter) for an example of how to create your character folder. 

**A tool for automatically generating this folder is coming soon**

```json
{
  "schema": 5,
  "poses": {
    "defaultMouthScale": 2.0,
    "defaultPose": "purple",
    "purple": {
      "image": "purple.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400,
      "facingLeft": false,
      "mouthScale": 1.0
    },
    "green": {
      "image": "green.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400,
      "facingLeft": false,
      "mouthScale": 1.0
    },
    "blue": {
      "image": "blue.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400,
      "facingLeft": false,
      "mouthScale": 1.0
    }
  },
  "eyes": {
    "scale": 0.8,
    "x": 640,
    "y": 300,
    "images": {
      "angry": "angry.png",
      "normal": "normal.png",
      "sad": "sad.png"
    }
  }
}
```

`poses` cantains the images that the chracter can do

`poses.default_mouth_scale` says how much the mouth should be scaled up or down. `poses.POSE.mouth_scale` is the same thing for a specific pose. These values are multiplied

`x` and `y` are the coordinates on the photo where the mouth should be placed.

`facingLeft` indicates whether to mirror the mouth image. 

`eyes` specifies a "placeable part". The sample character pose images don't have eyes, as these are specified by placeable parts. Although this example has placeable eyes, you can have placeable pins, objects in the background, or even hats.  `scale` specifies how much the placeable part image should be scaled up or down. `x` and `y` specify the location on the pose where the part should be placed. `images` contained key-value pairs where the key is the name of the part, and the value is the image name. This section shows angry, normal, and sad eye selections.

All pose images are in `CharacterFolder/poses`

All placeable part images are in `CharacterFolder/PART_NAME`

### Timestamps

The timestamps file is composed of a list of pose changes along with how many milliseconds into the animation the pose should change. For instance, if you wanted to swap to the `happy` pose after 3.5 seconds, the timestamps file will look like:

> 3500 happy

Additionally, you can change a placeable part by adding the type afterwards.

> 0 angry eyes

You can also remove a placeable part by using the name `None`

> 5000 None eyes

#### Custom Defaults



You can set custom default arguments by creating a file `config.json` in the main folder. In this file, the key is the command and the value is what you want the new default to be. For instance, if you wanted to always be set to verbose mode 3, your file will be:

```json
{
  "verbose": 3,
  "character": "/my/custom/path/super_awesome_character.json"
}
```
