## Installation

- Install the necessary prerequisites:
  - NodeJS 16+
  - [Gentle](https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle)
    - Mac users can use the prebuilt app.
    - Windows/Linux users will need to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
      - `docker pull lowerquality/gentle`
- Install typescript

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

- Download the code using git or the button in the top right

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matamata-Animator/Matamata-Core.git
```

- Open the folder in the terminal and install the dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

- Install Vosk model through the [Vosk website](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) or using the automatic tool. This is a 1.6 GB file and thus will take some time, please have patience. There is currently no progress bar implemented.
  - Note that although this step is reccomended, it is not neesarry if you manually provide a script text-file using `--text <path>`

```bash
npm run downloadModel
```

## Setup

### Character File

Below is a bare-bones character file:

```json
{
  "mouthsPath": "defaults/mouths/",
  "poses": {
    "imagesFolder": "defaults/SampleCharacter/faces/",
    "default": {
      "image": "purple.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400
    },
    "green": {
      "image": "blue.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400
    }
  }
}
```

`mouthsPath` specifies the path to a folder containing the mouth images.

`poses` contains two main elements. `imagesFolder` specifies the path to the folder which contains the pose images. `default` is a pose object. `image` refers to the name of the image inside the imagesFolder. `x` and `y` are the coordinates where the mouth should be placed. More poses can be created with more pose objects, as is shown with the `green` pose.

A more fleshed out character file could look like this:

```json
{
  "mouthsPath": "defaults/mouths/",
  "poses": {
    "imagesFolder": "defaults/SampleCharacter/faces/",
    "default_scale": 2,
    "default": {
      "image": "purple.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400,
      "facingLeft": false,
      "scale": 2
    },
    "green": {
      "image": "green.png",
      "x": 640,
      "y": 400,
      "facingLeft": false,
      "scale": 1
    }
  },
  "eyes": {
    "imagesFolder": "defaults/SampleCharacter/eyes/",
    "scale": 0.8,
    "x": 640,
    "y": 300,
    "images": {
      "angry": "angry.png",
      "normal": "normal.png",
      "sad": "sad.png"
    }
  }
}
```

`default_scale` says how much the mouth should be scaled up or down. `scale` is the same thing for a specific pose. In this case, the mouths for the `default` pose with be 4x the image size, while the mouths for the `green` pose will only be 2x the size.

`eyes` specifies a "placeable part". The sample character pose images don't have eyes, as these are specified by placeable parts. Although this example has placeable eyes, you can have placeable pins, objects in the background, or even hats. The `imagesFolder` specifies the path to the folder contains the images for the placeable part. `scale` specifies how much the placeable part image should be scaled up or down. `x` and `y` specify the location on the pose where the part should be placed. `images` contained key-value pairs where the key is the name of the part, and the value is the image name. This section shows angry, normal, and sad eye selections.

### Timestamps

The timestamps file is composed of a list of pose changes along with how many milliseconds into the animation the pose should change. For instance, if you wanted to swap to the `happy` pose after 3.5 seconds, the timestamps file will look like:

> 3500 happy

Additionally, you can change a placeable part by adding the type afterwards.

> 0 angry eyes

You can also remove a placeable part by using the name `None`

> 5000 None eyes

## Usage

### Arguments

#### Default Arguments

This covers the most important flags and arguments. For the complete list, go to [Default Arguments](defaults/default_args.json).

| --t      | --timestamps     |          | "defaults/output.mp4"      | str            | The path to the file containing pose timestamps. |
| --o      | --output         |          | "defaults/output.mp4"      | str            | The output of the program                        |
| --c      | --character      |          | "defaults/characters.json" | str            | The list of character poses                      |
| --m      | --mouths         |          | "defaults/phonemes.json"   | str            | The mouth pack and phonemes list                 |
| --V      | --verbose        |          | 1                          | int            | Dump process outputs to the shell                |
|          | --transcriber    |          | "vosk"                     | vosk \| watson | Transcriber service to use                       |
|          | --watson_api_key |          |                            | str            | API key for if `--transcriber watson` is used    |

#### Custom Defaults

You can set custom default arguments by creating a file `config.json` in the main folder. In this file, the key is the command and the value is what you want the new default to be. For instance, if you wanted to always be set to verbose mode 3, your file will be:

```json
{
  "verbose": 3,
  "character": "/my/custom/path/super_awesome_character.json"
}
```
